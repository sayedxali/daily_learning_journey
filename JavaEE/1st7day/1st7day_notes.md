## <span style='color: indigo'>Understanding JavaEE - The theory of JavaEE</span> 

### <span style='color: grey'>What is JavaEE?</span>

JavaEE a collection of **abstract** specs, that together form a complete solution, to solve *commonly faced challenges*.

* JavaEE is said to be abstract because; us developers are abstracted away from the implementation, we only code the JavaEE API's that we are given. 

  e.g. If we want to pass something to a relational database, we'll just have to call the `entity manager` from the `javax` package. There is no need to worry about what is implementing and what is going on behind the scene.

Some common faced challenges : Persistence, Web services, Transactions, Security, etc ...

### <span style='color: grey'>-</span>What is an Application Server?

An Implementation of the entire body of JavaEE abstract specifications is called "Application Server".

We are going to use all the implementation from `import javax.*` package (or also the newly `jakrata.*` package).

JavaEE is a set of specifications and standards that provides developers with a set of APIs for building enterprise-level applications. These APIs are *portable*, which means that they can be run on any compatible application server, regardless of the operating system or hardware platform. This ensures that applications built with JavaEE can run on any compatible platform without requiring any changes to the code.

JavaEE is *Portable* ; it means when we develop applications using the standard interfaces, we can then deploy it or we can then run it on any given JavaEE implementation and our application should work.

### <span style='color: grey'>Examples of JavaEE Application Server</span>

There are a bunch of servers provided to us :

* Payara Server (Glassfish)
* IBM OpenLiberty
* JBOSS Wildfly

all these app servers, implement the abstract specs meaning, when I'm developing, I can use IBM server for testing, and when it was in the stage of publication, I can switch to Glassfish.

If we are saying JavaEE is a collection of abstract specs, than why is there different APIs. For instance why is *Persistence API* different from *Dependency Injection API* ? These are realized with **JSR (Java Specification Request)**.

### <span style='color: grey'>What is a JSR</span>

JSR stands for "Java Specification Request", which is a formal proposal submitted by members of the Java community to the Java Community Process (JCP) for the development and enhancement of technology and the Java technology platform.

JSR defines a way to introduce new technologies or improvements to existing ones in the Java language, libraries, and frameworks. Each JSR outlines a specific problem that needs to be solved and a proposed solution for that.

> In simple words, these abstract specs are grouped in the form of silos in the form of JSRs.

### <span style='color: grey'>JSR Examples</span>

[JSRs by Platform](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/platform) : All the Java (JavaEE, JavaSE, JavaME) platforms are grouped here.

APIs available on the JavaEE platform : XML Parsing, Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), RESTful Web Service (JAX-RS), etc ...

The app server has already been implemented these specifications. So when we want to create a let's say RESTful GET web service, we can use the annotation or whatever the method is. The app server will run without any errors. 

> In conclusion, the JSR specs tell us what we can do with specific API. Like a guide or documentation of the API.

For every JSR, there is a *Reference implementation*.

### <span style='color: grey'>What is a Reference Implementation?</span>

A complete realization of the abstract JSRs is what is called a Reference Implementation. 

For Instance, JAX-RS API has reference implementation in the form of *Jersey*. 



> In conclusion : application server is a collections of various reference implementations for the JavaEE JSRs. 
>
> That is why when we code against various individuals JavaEE APIs, we can simply run it on app server; because app server bundles various JavaEE reference implementation.

* JavaEE is a JSR. For instance, JavaEE8 is a JSR366 and it's Reference implementation is Glassfish5 application server.

* JSR, or Bean Validation API, has Hibernate as its implementation.
* Java Persistence API, has EclipseLink and also hibernate as its implementation.

### <span style='color: grey'>What is JakartaEE?</span>

JakartaEE is essentially JavaEE going forward. It is hosted by Eclipse Foundation. JakartaEE is going to be an upgrade JavaEE.

There are a lot of members in JakartaEE project, like :

* Strategic members : Oracle, IBM, RedHat, Payara, Futisu, etc ...
* Participating members : Microsoft, Vaadin, etc ... 

### <span style='color: grey'>JavaEE/JakartaEE vs Spring Framework</span>

In the past, JavaEE was quite complex and difficult to use, and as a result, the Spring Framework became very popular as an alternative for developing enterprise-level applications. However, one of the downsides of the Spring Framework was that developers had to write a lot of configuration files in XML, which was also not the easiest thing to write and maintain.

So, in order to make JavaEE more developer-friendly, JavaEE started to adopt some of the features of the Spring Framework.

In conclusion, JavaEE and Spring have influenced each other in terms of development practices and have evolved to provide developers with more convenient options.

Spring boot is influence by JavaEE.

> There is no JavaEE vs Spring, it is JavaEE & Spring. It is us developers that who choose what solves our problem.

* In JavaEE, it is Convention over Configuration.
* Spring also uses some of JavaEE APIs.

## <span style='color: indigo'>Setup</span> 

- Install JDK
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc)
- Install git (Version control)
- Install REST Client (Insomnia, Postman, etc) => (Intuitive REST client that makes easier to interact with RESTful endpoints easier)
- Install Maven (Download the zip and extract it in C and then add to the environment path => 
  	1. Create a new *Variable* for java : JAVA_HOME, the value is JDK
  	1. Create a new *Path*, and browse to the bin directory of maven)
- Install application server (Tomcat, Glassfish, **Payara**, WildFly, IBM, TomEE, etc) (I'm going to use Payara, since apache tomcat alone only supports Java Servlet & Java Server Pages (JSP) specifications, and does not have support for full JavaEE specifications & technologies like EJBs, JMS and CDI)

### <span style='color: grey'>Deploy</span>

Simple hello world JavaEE application :

- create a new java enterprise project (IntelliJ)

- choose JavaEE8

- add JavaEE dependency

  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>javax</groupId>
      <artifactId>javaee-api</artifactId>
  	<version>8.0.1</version>
  	<scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
  <!-- the provided scope : the container (war) will make the JavaEE APIs available for our application, when we deploy it on app server. -->
  ```

- for deploying it, we need to package our application into a war file (we'll use maven to package our project) and run it on payara app server.

  Deployment : head to where the payara-micro.jar is : open a command line :

  ```xml
  java -jar payara-micro-6.jar --deploy path\to\target\folder\of_project\name_of_project.war --port 9393
  ```

  **- <u>note</u> : the path to the payara-micro.jar should not have any spaces or else you'll encounter error!**



## <span style='color: indigo'>Getting your feet wet | A simple training to get an overview</span>

Trying to build  a Todo application along-side the tutorial so that I can get an overview of JavaEE.

JPA : It is a set of annotation driven API that we can use to transform simple plain ol' java objects (POJOs) to entities that we can persist in Database.

* `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)`

- `@PrePersist` : we can make a method as lifecycle callback method so that if we need to initialize a property in JPA entity, it'll get executed first and initialized. 

  *In short : just before a property is persisted in db, the method will be set for us.*

   *e.g.* 

  ``` java
  ...
  public class Todo {
      ...
      private LocalDate createdAt;
      
      /* to create a date on creation
       we'll create a listener or a lifecycle point in entity class to do that */
      @PrePersist
      private void init() { // to make this a lifecycle callback method : @PrePersist
          setDateCreated(LocalDate.now());
      }
      
      // getters & setters & constructors - or use lombok
      ...
  }
  ```

### <span style='color: grey'>Persistence Unit</span>

Created a JPA entity. Every JPA entity needs one Persistence Unit (a collection of entities that manage together as a group).

This persistence unit will lump* all, or persist all entities as a unit that will be manage together by an entity manager.

[^* lump : group or something like that]: persistence unit

This persistence unit is found in `src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml` 

+ This file, configures which db it is supposed to save, update, query, and deletes the entity object.
+ This file, has configuration for ORM.

it looks something like this :

```xml
<persistence 
             xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence" 	
             version="3.0">

    <persistence-unit name="todo" transaction-type="JTA">
        <exclude-unlisted-classes>false</exclude-unlisted-classes>
        <properties>
            <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="drop-and-create"/>
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>

</persistence>
```

> In order for IntelliJ to be able to create a persistence unit, we need to add JPA specification & EclipseLink as implementation in our project as dependency!
>
> Then double shift => Persistence => open persistence pallet => create a new persistence unit
>
> ```xml
> <dependency>
>  <groupId>org.eclipse.persistence</groupId>
>  <artifactId>eclipselink</artifactId>
> 	<version>4.0.1</version>
> </dependency>
> ```
>
> 

### <span style='color: grey'>`@Transactional`</span>

This annotation will turn a simple java class into a service.

For every method that is called, a transaction will be invoked.

How can we persist a data? we need an entity manager, it is an interface from JPA API.

```java
@PersistenceContext
private EntityManager entityManager;
```

​	we have created an instance of entity manager (remember, 	this is only an overview, we'll get into these in more details 	later on).

`@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)`

`@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)`

`@Inject`

`@POST, @GET, @PUT`

`@Path`

### <span style='color: grey'>RESTful Endpoint</span>

Creating a RESTful endpoint so that our project that we will be 

using to interact with our application.

`@ApplicationPath("api/v1")` : root path to our application's endpoint. `import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;`

### <span style='color: grey'>Deployment</span>

`mvn package` : makes a web archive (WAR) file.

## <span style='color: indigo'>Zero progress</span>

Today, I had **zero progress** in my learning journey. It can be discouraging, but it's important to remember that progress is not always linear. As I continue my 90-day journey of learning Java EE, Maintaining the already learned concepts of Spring Boot, and enhancing it bit by bit, and also a little bit of DSA, I am bound to have days where I don't make any progress.

### <span style='color: grey'>Packaging & Deploying web application on payara micro - method 1</span>

After our basic todo application is made, with basic CRUD operations (three architecture layer, Controller => Service => Repository => DB), we now have to deploy it on an application server.

I'm using payara server. 

- We can use either the `payara micro` which is a jar file 

  - for running :

    1.  First build the project into war file using maven `mvn package`

    2.  `java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy location\to\the_built_war_file --port 8080 `

- or use `payara full community edition`

  - for running :
    1. hello



### <span style='color: grey'>Validation</span>

Learned & Reviewed some bean validation annotations, such as :

- `@NotEmpty, @NotNull, @Size`
- learned new annotations : 
  - `@FutureOrPresent` : user is bound to insert a date due to present or in the future, the past is not valid.
  - `@JsonDateFormat(value = "yyyy-MM-dd")` : the date that is being inserted from the REST client, will get formatted into Java understandable format.

### <span style='color: grey'>JavaEE Uber Jar</span>

Essentially build a fat jar with everything bundled including the application server just like spring, and we run `java -jar` to run our application or pick that jar and deploy it anywhere on JVM and it'll run.

To do so : 

```xml
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy path\to\warfile.war --port 8008 --outputUberJar any_name_for_deploying_jar.jar
```

[^--port 8008]: this port is for when we run the uber jar, the port for that application will be set to 8008 and the same goes to accessing RESTful endpoints.

> There is a note that I'd like to point out to...
>
> the payara micro server that I downloaded,  the version is 6 which is the highest version. The problem is, this version only supports JavaEE10 & JakartaEE10. Although it will run with JavaEE/JakartaEE 8 & 9, it won't show the REST endpoints and it'd be useless for us. 
>
> The version that supports JavaEE/JakartaEE 8 & 9, is payara version 5!

### <span style='color: grey'>Packaging & Deploying with Payara micro - method 2</span>

By using payara maven profile!

```xml
<profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>payara</id>

                </plugins>
            </build>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
```

now for running : `mvn package payara-micro:start`



### <span style='color: grey'>༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つSummarize</span>

Java EE (now known as Jakarta EE) is indeed a collection of abstract specifications or APIs that help developers to build enterprise applications in Java. These APIs provide standardized interfaces for accessing common services such as database access, messaging, and web services.

Application servers, also known as servlet containers, are software platforms that provide an environment in which Java EE applications can run. They include a servlet engine, which handles HTTP requests and responses, and other components that provide services required by Java EE applications.

However, it's important to note that while application servers do provide an implementation of the Java EE/Jakarta EE specifications, they are not the only way to run these applications. Other deployment options include using lightweight containers such as Tomcat or Jetty, or even running Java EE applications directly on a standalone JVM without any container.

**Three key APIs to JavaEE Mastery**

- JPA
- CDI
- JAX-RS

> It doesn't mean you shouldn't learn other APIs!

## <span style='color: indigo'>CDI - Context & Dependency Injection</span>

We need a `bean.xml` file for CDI API to get activated.

### <span style='color: grey'>What is Dependency Injection</span>

Dependency injection is a specific form of Inversion of control (IoC).

**IoC =>** It is a software paradigm where individual components have there dependencies supply to them instead creating the them themselves.

So simply put, we tell the container what we want, we just declare a dependency on a specific type, and the container takes it upon itself to make that type available on the business component. We externalize the creation of object and dependencies in our application. 

e.g. instead of saying `Foobar foobar = new Foobar();` we simply tell the CDI runtime that give me this particular object, and then it becomes the duty of CDI container to make that object available to you.

1. Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows components to be loosely coupled by injecting their dependencies at runtime.
2. By using a CDI container to inject dependencies, you can create more modular, testable, and maintainable code.
3. When using a CDI container, classes are loosely coupled because they do not depend **directly** on each other, but rather rely on the container to manage their dependencies.
4. Loosely coupled components make it easier to change implementations, swap out components, and unit test individual components in isolation.
5. When using dependency injection, each component can focus on doing its own job without worrying about how to create or manage other components it depends on. This means that the component's code is easier to understand and maintain, since it only needs to deal with its own logic. It also makes testing easier, because you can test each component in isolation without having to worry about the behavior of other components.

In summary, with DI we externalize the management of dependencies to the container.

### <span style='color: grey'>Inversion of Control</span>

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle that is closely related to dependency injection. IoC refers to the idea of inverting the flow of control in a software component, where instead of the component controlling the creation and management of its dependencies, it delegates that responsibility to an external entity.

In other words, a software component should not create or manage its own dependencies; rather, it should rely on an external entity to provide them. This external entity can be a framework, a container, or any other object that manages the lifecycle of the component's dependencies.

Dependency injection is one way to achieve IoC. By using dependency injection, you are delegating the responsibility of managing the dependencies of a component to an external entity (such as a CDI container), thereby achieving IoC.

Here's an example to illustrate how IoC works:

Suppose you have a `TodoController` class that depends on a `TodoService` class to perform some business logic. Here's how you could create the `TodoService` instance using IoC:

```java
public class TodoController {
    private TodoService todoService;

    public TodoController(TodoService todoService) {
        this.todoService = todoService;
    }

    // Rest of the code ...
}
```

In this example, `TodoController` does not create or manage the `TodoService` instance. Instead, it delegates that responsibility to the caller of its constructor, which could be a framework, a test class, or any other external entity. This is an example of IoC, since `TodoController` is no longer in control of creating and managing its dependencies.

In summary, Inversion of Control is a design principle where a component's responsibility for managing its dependencies is delegated to an external entity. Dependency Injection is one way to achieve IoC by relying on an external entity (such as a CDI container) to inject dependencies into a component.

### <span style='color: grey'>༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つSummarize</span>

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle that helps developers create more flexible software components by <u>delegating the responsibility of managing an object's dependencies to an external entity</u>. Instead of each component creating its own dependencies, they rely on an external entity to provide those dependencies.

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a technique that implements IoC by <u>injecting dependencies into objects instead of having the objects create or manage them themselves</u>. This makes it easier to change implementations, swap out components, and unit test individual components in isolation.

By using DI, developers can write more modular and maintainable code with loosely coupled components that are easier to test and modify. It's an important concept to understand for anyone looking to improve their software development skills.



### <span style='color: grey'>CDI Features </span>

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>Type safe Dependency</span>

The typesafe feature of the CDI API ensures that the dependency injection process is type-safe. This means that the compiler can detect any errors in the usage of classes, interfaces, and other types at compile time rather than at runtime.

In practical terms, this feature allows developers to use annotations to specify dependencies between components in a Java EE application. The container then automatically injects the correct dependencies at runtime, based on the information provided by the annotations.

The typesafe feature helps to reduce errors and improve maintainability by ensuring that dependencies are correctly declared and used throughout the application. It also simplifies the development process by reducing the need for manual configuration and wiring of components.

##### <span style='color: pink'>e.g.</span>

Suppose you have a Java class that processes credit card payments. You want to ensure that this class is only injected with objects of the `CreditCardProcessor` type. Using the Typesafe feature of CDI, you can enforce this at compile time.

First, you need to define a custom qualifier annotation for the `CreditCardProcessor` class:

```java
import javax.inject.Qualifier;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import static java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME;

@Qualifier
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface CreditCard {}
```

In this example, the `@CreditCard` annotation serves as a marker that you can use to identify instances of the `CreditCardProcessor` class.

Next, you need to annotate your `CreditCardProcessor` class with this new qualifier annotation:

```java
import javax.inject.Singleton;

@Singleton
@CreditCard
public class CreditCardProcessor {
    // implementation omitted for brevity
}
```

Now that your `CreditCardProcessor` class is annotated with the `@CreditCard` annotation, you can inject it into other classes using the `@Inject` annotation and the `@CreditCard` qualifier:

```java
import javax.inject.Inject;

public class PaymentService {
    @Inject
    @CreditCard
    private CreditCardProcessor processor;
    // other service logic omitted for brevity
}
```

In this example, the `PaymentService` class injects an instance of the `CreditCardProcessor` class using the `@Inject` annotation and the `@CreditCard` qualifier. This ensures that only instances of the `CreditCardProcessor` class are injected, and any attempts to inject other types will result in a compile-time error.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>Lifecycle Context</span>

The lifecycle context feature of the CDI API allows for the management of the lifecycle of beans within an application.

CDI provides a set of built-in contexts, each of which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of beans in a particular way. These contexts include:

1. RequestScoped: beans that exist for the duration of a single HTTP request.
2. SessionScoped: beans that exist for the duration of a user's session with an application.
3. ApplicationScoped: beans that exist for the entire lifespan of an application.
4. Dependent: beans that are created and destroyed along with the objects that depend on them.

These different lifecycle contexts help to ensure that beans are created and destroyed at the appropriate times, based on the needs of the application. They also help to manage resource usage and prevent memory leaks by ensuring that beans are only kept in memory for as long as they are needed.

Developers can also create custom lifecycle contexts using the CDI API, allowing for even more fine-grained control over the lifecycle of beans within an application.

##### <span style='color: pink'>e.g.</span> 

Suppose you have a web application that allows users to log in and access personalized content based on their account information. You can use CDI's Context feature to scope objects to the current user session. This ensures that each user's data is kept separate from other users' data.

To do this, you might define a custom CDI scope called "SessionScoped" that corresponds to the user's session. You can then annotate your managed beans with this scope to ensure that they are only available within the scope of the current user's session.

Here's some example code to illustrate how this might work:

```java
import javax.enterprise.context.SessionScoped;
import java.io.Serializable;

`@SessionScoped`
public class UserAccount implements Serializable {
    private String username;
    private String password;
    // getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
```

In this example, the `UserAccount` class is annotated with the ``@SessionScoped`` annotation, which tells CDI to create a new instance of this class for each user session. The `Serializable` interface is included so that instances of this class can be stored in the user session.

You can then inject instances of this class into other managed beans using the `@Inject` annotation:

```java
import javax.inject.Inject;

public class UserProfileController {
    @Inject
    private UserAccount userAccount;
    // other controller logic omitted for brevity
}
```

In this example, the `UserProfileController` class injects an instance of the `UserAccount` class using the `@Inject` annotation. Because the `UserAccount` class is annotated with ``@SessionScoped``, a new instance of this class will be created for each user session, ensuring that each user's data is kept separate.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>Interceptors</span>

Just as the name implies, The Interceptor feature in CDI API allows you to define interceptors for your managed beans. An interceptor is a class that can intercept method invocations on another class, allowing you to add cross-cutting concerns such as logging or security checks. they intercept the requests to methods so you can have interceptors do cross-cutting work for your business application.

For instance, I can have a method that before it gets invoked, I want to log certain specifics properties of the request or whoever is logged-in, I use interceptor to do that. So based on our logic implementation, after the interceptor is invoked before the method, we can then allow it to proceed or abort the request. 

##### <span style='color: pink'>e.g.</span>

Suppose you have a method that performs some expensive computation, and you want to log how long it takes to run. You can use an interceptor to log the method's execution time without modifying the original method.

First, you need to define an interceptor class with a method that logs the method's execution time:

```java
import javax.interceptor.AroundInvoke;
import javax.interceptor.Interceptor;
import javax.interceptor.InvocationContext;

@Interceptor
public class PerformanceLoggingInterceptor {
    @AroundInvoke
    public Object logPerformance(InvocationContext context) throws Exception {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        try {
            return context.proceed();
        } finally {
            long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println("Method " + context.getMethod().getName() + " took " + (endTime - startTime) + "ms to execute.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `PerformanceLoggingInterceptor` class is defined as an interceptor by annotating it with the `@Interceptor` annotation. The `logPerformance` method is annotated with the `@AroundInvoke` annotation, which indicates that it should be invoked before and after the intercepted method call. Within this method, we record the start time, call the actual method using `context.proceed()`, record the end time, and print a message indicating how long the method took to execute.

Next, you need to annotate your target method with the `@Interceptors` annotation to apply the interceptor:

```java
import javax.ejb.Stateless;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.interceptor.Interceptors;

@Stateless
public class MyService {
    @Inject
    private SomeDependency dependency;

    @Interceptors(PerformanceLoggingInterceptor.class)
    public void doSomethingExpensive() {
        // Expensive computation
        dependency.doSomethingElse();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `doSomethingExpensive` method is annotated with the `@Interceptors` annotation and passed in the `PerformanceLoggingInterceptor` class. This indicates that any calls to the `doSomethingExpensive` method should be intercepted by the `PerformanceLoggingInterceptor`.

When you run your application and call the `doSomethingExpensive` method, the `PerformanceLoggingInterceptor` will intercept the method call and log how long it took to execute.

By using an interceptor, you can add additional functionality or behavior to a method without modifying the original method, making your code more maintainable and flexible.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>Events</span>

The Event feature in CDI API provides a way to decouple components in an application by allowing them to send and receive messages asynchronously.

The Event feature is based on the Observer pattern, where one component (the observer) registers to receive notifications from another component (the subject). In CDI, the subject is called the "event producer" and the observer is called the "event consumer".

It's a way for us to develop a highly decoupled applications such that, one component can send data to another component without any form of connection or relation between them.

You can create an event, then you can fire that event. Once you have done that, you have listeners to listen in for firing the events. Those listeners will be informed of the event.

CDI 2.0 introduced Asynchronous event.

##### <span style='color: pink'>e.g.</span>

Let's say you have an application that manages a list of tasks. Whenever a task is completed, you want to log a message to the console saying that it has been completed.

First, you define an event type that represents a completed task:

```Java
public class TaskCompletedEvent {
    private final String taskId;

    public TaskCompletedEvent(String taskId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
    }

    public String getTaskId() {
        return taskId;
    }
}
```

Next, you create a class that will produce events when tasks are completed:

```Java
@ApplicationScoped
public class TaskManager {
    @Inject
    private Event<TaskCompletedEvent> taskCompletedEvent;

    public void completeTask(String taskId) {
        // Do some logic to mark the task as completed

        // Fire a TaskCompletedEvent
        taskCompletedEvent.fire(new TaskCompletedEvent(taskId));
    }
}
```

This class has a method called `completeTask` which takes a `taskId` and performs some logic to mark the task as completed. After that, it creates a new `TaskCompletedEvent` object with the `taskId` and fires it using the `taskCompletedEvent` instance.

Finally, you create a class that observes the `TaskCompletedEvent` and logs a message to the console:

```Java
@RequestScoped
public class TaskLogger {
    public void logTaskCompletion(@Observes TaskCompletedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Task " + event.getTaskId() + " has been completed.");
    }
}
```

This class has a method called `logTaskCompletion` which observes the `TaskCompletedEvent`. When an event is fired, this method is called and logs a message to the console indicating that the task has been completed.

Now, whenever you call the `completeTask` method on the `TaskManager`, an event will be fired and the `TaskLogger` will log a message to the console indicating that the task has been completed.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>Service Provider Interface (SPI)</span>

The SPI (Service Provider Interface) feature in CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) API allows third-party providers to extend or replace the default behavior of the CDI container. This is achieved by implementing specific interfaces defined in the CDI specification, which allows the provider to provide its own implementations of key components such as bean discovery, injection resolution, and context management.

Using the SPI feature, custom extensions can be developed for specific use cases that are not covered by the standard CDI functionality. For example, a provider might implement a custom bean discovery mechanism to automatically discover beans in a specific package or provide an alternative context implementation for managing scoped objects. It it used to make our own CDI API extensions. Just like we have finder queries in spring data JPA, we also have the same thing in JavaEE platform through the use of SPI interface with a CDI extension.

##### <span style='color: pink'>e.g.</span>

Let's say you have an application that uses CDI for dependency injection, and you want to provide a custom implementation for handling transactions. You can use the SPI feature to extend the CDI container with your own transaction management implementation.

First, you need to create a provider class that implements the `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension` interface. This class will define the behavior of your custom extension:

```java
public class TransactionExtension implements Extension {
    public void beforeBeanDiscovery(@Observes BeforeBeanDiscovery event) {
        // register our custom Bean<TxManager> with the container
        event.addAnnotatedType(TxManager.class, "txManager");
    }

    public void processInjectionTarget(@Observes ProcessInjectionTarget<?> event) {
        AnnotatedType<?> annotatedType = event.getAnnotatedType();
        if (annotatedType.getJavaClass().equals(MyService.class)) {
            // replace the default TxManager injection with our custom one
            InjectionTarget<?> target = event.getInjectionTarget();
            event.setInjectionTarget(new MyServiceInjectionTarget(target));
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we're defining a custom `TxManager` bean and replacing the default injection of `TxManager` in `MyService` with our custom implementation.

Next, you need to specify the provider class in a file named `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension` located in the `META-INF/services` directory of your application:

```java
com.example.TransactionExtension
```

Finally, you can inject your custom `TxManager` bean into your service using the `@Inject` annotation as follows:

```java
public class MyService {
    @Inject
    private TxManager txManager;

    // ...
}
```

By doing this, the CDI container will invoke the `TransactionExtension` methods to register the custom `TxManager` bean and replace the default injection of `TxManager` in `MyService` with our custom implementation.

### <span style='color: grey'>Bean Discovery Mode</span>

Bean discovery mode is a feature in CDI that determines how beans are discovered and registered by the container. There are two bean discovery modes in CDI:

1. Annotated Bean Discovery Mode: In this mode, the CDI container discovers beans based on annotations such as `@javax.inject.Named`, `@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`, `@javax.enterprise.inject.Produces`, etc. Any Java class with one or more of these annotations is considered a bean and is automatically registered with the container.
2. All Bean Discovery Mode: In this mode, the CDI container discovers all Java classes in the archive (classpath) and registers them as beans, unless they are explicitly excluded using an extension or other configuration mechanism.

The default bean discovery mode in CDI 2.0 is annotated discovery mode. However, you can change the bean discovery mode using the beans.xml file, which is a deployment descriptor for CDI archives.

my own words : It refers to a mechanism which the DI runtime, analyzes and then discovers beans for it.

We need a `bean.xml` file for CDI API to get activated. And if by default CDI API is omitted, then we get the `annotated` mode.

`Annotated` : Beans that will be eligible by CDI runtime, are classes that are annotated with certain specific CDI annotations.

So, bean discovery means, that the CDI will scan your archive at boot time, and then will gather all those beans that are annotated with CDI specific annotations and will make them eligible for management.

`All` : Every single bean that we create in our application, is eligible to be managed by JavaEE CDI runtime.

### <span style='color: grey'>CDI Container</span>

In the context of the CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) API, a container refers to the runtime environment that manages the lifecycle of objects and their dependencies. It's responsible for discovering beans (managed objects), instantiating them, and injecting their dependencies.

The CDI container provides a set of services for managing object lifecycles, such as defining scopes for beans, managing injection points, and handling events. It also provides a set of built-in contexts that define the lifecycle of a bean, such as request, session, and application scopes.

In summary, the CDI container is the central component that manages the lifecycle of objects in a CDI-enabled application.

A container is like a factory, where Java classes goes in, and comes out with certain specific features and functionality.

# Day 7/90

## <span style='color: indigo'>CDI - Context & Dependency Injection</span>

### <span style='color: grey'>What are Beans and Contextual Instances?</span>

*Bean* : a bean is simply a template that a developer makes.

*Contextual Instance* : it is an instance of a bean that is created by CDI container and managed by it.

### <span style='color: grey'>CDI Injection Point</span>

what is an injection point? CDI Injection Point is one of the core concepts of CDI.  It is the point where the CDI container can inject the dependency for you.

An Injection point is a location in your code where you want to inject a particular object or value to satisfy a dependency. In CDI, Injection points are represented by specific annotations such as `@Inject`.

The CDI container uses these Injection Points to resolve dependencies for you automatically at runtime, without you having to explicitly provide objects or values. The container looks for objects that match the type of the Injection Point, and it provides the matching object to the Injection Point.

=> So, a CDI Injection Point is simply a place in your code where you want to use automatic dependency injection provided by the CDI container. You can annotate a field, method, or constructor with the `@Inject` annotation to mark it as an Injection Point.

Field, Constructor and method injections are the Injection Points!

> If we don't inject into a dependency, and we go ahead and use it in our methods, we'll get `NullPointerException` because we nor the CDI container, nor ourselves created any instance of that dependency.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>Field Injection</span>

Field Injection is a type of dependency injection where dependencies are injected into the fields of a class. In Java, this is typically done using the `@Inject` annotation from the CDI framework. 

> It requests the CDI container for a contextual instance, to be injected into a particular field.

```java
public class MyService {
    @Inject
    private MyDependency myDependency;
    // ...
}
```

One advantage of Field Injection is that it can make **your code more concise**, since you don't need to create constructor or setter methods just to inject dependencies. However, some argue that it can make your code less testable, since it can be harder to mock dependencies for unit testing.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>Constructor Injection</span>

Constructor Injection is a type of dependency injection where dependencies are injected via a class constructor. In Java, this is typically done using the `@Inject` annotation from the CDI framework.

```Java
public class MyService {
    private final MyDependency myDependency;

    @Inject
    public MyService(MyDependency myDependency) {
        this.myDependency = myDependency;
    }
    // ...
}
```

One advantage of Constructor Injection is that it can make your code more **testable**, since it allows you to easily inject mock dependencies for unit testing. It also helps ensure that all required dependencies are available before a new instance of the class is created.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>Method Injection</span>

In the context of the CDI API in Java EE, method injection refers to a way of injecting dependencies directly into a method of a bean instead of injecting them through the constructor or setter methods.

```Java
public class MyBean {
  
  private MyDependency dependency;
  
  @Inject
  public void setDependency(MyDependency dependency) {
    this.dependency = dependency;
  } 
  //...
}
```

Method injection can be useful when you need to inject dependencies into a specific method of a bean, rather than to the bean's constructor or setter methods. It can also be used to inject dependencies into non-public methods, which cannot be done with constructor or setter injection.

### <span style='color: grey'>CDI Lifecycle Callback</span>

In the CDI API, a lifecycle callback is a method that gets invoked by the container at various points during the lifecycle of a bean.

There are two types of lifecycle callbacks in CDI:

1. Initialization callbacks: These methods are called after dependency injection has occurred but before the bean is put into service. They are annotated with the `@PostConstruct` annotation.
2. Destruction callbacks: These methods are called when the bean is being destroyed or removed from service. They are annotated with the `@PreDestroy` annotation.

Initialization callbacks are useful for performing any initialization work that needs to be done before the bean can be used. For example, initializing a database connection or setting up a logger.

Destruction callbacks are useful for releasing any resources that the bean has acquired during its lifetime. For example, closing a database connection or releasing a file handle.

in my own words : Lifecycle callback, is a point in a lifecycle of a bean, that the CDI container gives us the opportunity to do certain specific things.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>PostConstruct</span>

In the CDI API, `@PostConstruct` is a lifecycle callback method that is invoked immediately after a managed bean has been instantiated and its dependencies have been injected.

The `@PostConstruct` annotation can be applied to any method of a managed bean class, and that method will be called automatically by the CDI container after the object has been constructed and all its dependencies have been injected.

Typically, you would use `@PostConstruct` to perform any initialization or setup that needs to happen after the bean has been created but before it is used. For example, you might use `@PostConstruct` to open database connections, initialize data structures, or start background threads.

By using lifecycle callback methods like `@PostConstruct`, you can separate the logic for constructing and initializing an object from the rest of the application logic, which can make your code more modular, easier to test, and easier to maintain.

> It is a point at which all the beans & dependencies have been created and all initialization have been completed, and are ready to use just before putting it in action or putting it in service!

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>PreDestroy</span>

In the CDI API, `@PreDestroy` is a lifecycle callback method that is invoked just before a managed bean is destroyed by the container.

The `@PreDestroy` annotation can be applied to any method of a managed bean class, and that method will be called automatically by the CDI container just before the object is destroyed. Typically, you would use `@PreDestroy` to perform any cleanup or teardown that needs to happen before the bean is destroyed. For example, you might use `@PreDestroy` to close database connections, release resources, or stop background threads.

By using lifecycle callback methods like `@PreDestroy`, you can ensure that any necessary cleanup happens in a timely and orderly manner, without relying on the garbage collector to handle it for you. This can help prevent resource leaks and other issues that can occur if you don't properly clean up after your objects.

It's important to note that the exact timing of `@PreDestroy` method invocation is not guaranteed. The CDI specification only requires that `@PreDestroy` methods are called before the bean is destroyed, but it does not specify when exactly that will happen.

> It gets invoked just before the bean & or dependency is destroyed and made available for garbage collection.

### <span style='color: grey'>Managed Beans & Bean Types</span>

*Managed Bean* : the CDI API, a managed bean is a Java object that is instantiated, initialized, and managed by the CDI container. Managed beans are used to implement the business logic and control flow of an application.

Managed beans are annotated with the `@javax.inject.Named` annotation or the `@javax.enterprise.context` annotations such as `@RequestScoped`, ``@SessionScoped``, `@ApplicationScoped`, etc. These annotations define the scope of the bean and its lifecycle within the container.

*Bean Types* : In the CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) API, a bean type is a type that may be injected or looked up by its clients. A bean type can be a class or an interface, and it is used to define the contract between the producer of a bean and its consumer.

A bean type must be specified on the `@javax.enterprise.inject.Produces` annotation, which is used to declare a producer method or field. The producer method or field must return an object whose class or interface matches the bean type.

Bean types are also used in qualifiers, which are annotations that further specify the injection point of a bean. Qualifiers allow you to differentiate between multiple beans of the same type that have different characteristics or configurations.



> What is a Managed Bean?
>
> A managed bean, is any bean that 1. it is eligible for CDI management/injection, 2. it is managed by CDI container.
>
> 
>
> What is a Bean Type? 
>
> Bean type refers to a concrete type of a bean, or the type to which a bean is related, such that we can say "this bean, is of this type".

### <span style='color: grey'>CDI Qualifiers</span>

In the CDI API, a qualifier is a type-safe way to distinguish between beans *that implement the same interface or extend the same class*. Qualifiers allow you to specify which bean to use when there are multiple beans of the same type in the application context.

A qualifier is defined as an annotation that is applied to a bean, and it can include additional metadata that helps to further differentiate the bean. For example, the `@Named` annotation is a built-in qualifier in CDI that allows you to give a bean a unique name.

Here's an example of how you might use a custom qualifier annotation:

```Java
@Qualifier
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({ ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER })
public @interface MyQualifier {
    String value();
}
```

With this custom qualifier annotation, you can annotate your beans like this:

```java
@MyQualifier("foo")
public class FooBean implements MyInterface { ... }

@MyQualifier("bar")
public class BarBean implements MyInterface { ... }
```

Then, in another bean where you want to inject one of these two beans, you can specify which one to use based on the qualifier:

```java
@Inject
@MyQualifier("foo")
private MyInterface myFoo;

@Inject
@MyQualifier("bar")
private MyInterface myBar;
```

This tells CDI to inject the bean with the `@MyQualifier("foo")` annotation into the `myFoo` field, and the bean with the `@MyQualifier("bar")` annotation into the `myBar` field.



another example :

Suppose we have a `Salute` interface with one method. This interface is implemented by 2 Java classes (`Police`,`Soldier`). When we inject the implementation of this interface, the CDI container won't know which are you calling. Do you mean salute of police? or the soldier? so there is an ambiguity. To resolve this, we'll use qualifier, and mark our implementation classes with them to separate them and make them distinguishable for CDI container.

```Java
public inteface Salute {
    String salute(String salute);
}
```

java classes that implement salute :

```java
@Police
// other annotations...
public class Police implements Salute {
    @Override
    public String salute(String salute) {
        return MessageFormat.format("Sir, Yes Sir, {0}", salute);
    }
}
```

```java
@Soldier
// other annotations...
public class Soldier implements Salute {
    @Override
    public String salute(String salute) {
        return MessageFormat.format("All Hail to, {0}", salute);
    }
}
```

```java
public Class DemoQualifierBean {
    @Inject
    @Police
    private Salute policeSalute;
    
    @Inject
    @Soldier
    private Salute soldierSalute;
    
    // other methods that use the Salute ...
}
```





Now the CDI container knows, when we call the police salute, we mean Police's implementation and same for soldier.



> Qualifiers are annotations that you create/use, to tell the CDI container the exact type of contextual instance (instance of bean/dependency) to be resolved to. 

####  <span style='color: #6B5B95'>Creating Qualifiers with Values</span>

From the previous example, Instead of creating 2 different qualifier interfaces, we can make one qualifier that takes values of a specific type.

```java
@Qualifier
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER})
public @interface ServiceMan {
    ServiceType value();
    
    public enum ServiceType {
        SOLDIER, POLICE
    }
}
```

the changes for the `Soldier` and `Police` :

```java
//  @Soldier   <-- we won't use single qualifier
@ServiceMan(value = ServiceMan.ServiceType.POLICE)
public class Soldier implements Salute {
    @Override
    public String salute(String salute) {
        return MessageFormat.format("All Hail to, {0}", salute);
    }
}
```

```java
// @Police   <-- we won't use single qualifier
@ServiceMan(value = ServiceMan.ServiceType.POLICE)
public class Police implements Salute {
    @Override
    public String salute(String salute) {
        return MessageFormat.format("Sir, Yes Sir, {0}", salute);
    }
}
```

the same goes for the class that is calling :

```java
public Class DemoQualifierBean {
    @Inject
    @ServiceMan(value = ServiceMan.ServiceType.POLICE)
//    @Police  <-- not using single interface qualifier
    private Salute policeSalute;
    
    @Inject
    @ServiceMan(value = ServiceMan.ServiceType.POLICE)
//    @Soldier  <-- not using single interface qualifier
    private Salute soldierSalute;
    
    // other methods that use the Salute ...
}
```

> more efficient ;)

### <span style='color: grey'>CDI Stereotypes</span>

In CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection), a stereotype is a specialized annotation that allows developers to quickly apply a set of related annotations to a class.

The CDI API provides several built-in stereotypes, such as `@Model`, `@Controller`, and `@Repository`, which are commonly used in web application development with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

By using a stereotype annotation, you can apply a group of related annotations to a class with a single annotation, rather than individually annotating each field or method. This can help make your code more concise and easier to read.

example for creating our own stereotype :

```java
@Stereotype
@RequestScoped
@Named
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNITME)
@Target(ElementType.TYPE) //class level only
public @interface Web {
    
}

// now we can use @Web anywhere we want
```



> what are stereotypes? 
>
> There are times where we need to use different annoations on single type, and repeating it throughout is very tedious and repetitive.
>
> Stereotype is collection of annotations grouped together as one, to solve this tedious problem.
>
> => It is same as `@RestController` in spring boot which is a combination of `@Controller` & `@ResponseBody`. 

### <span style='color: grey'>`@Named`</span>

The `@Named` annotation is a Java annotation that can be used to specify a name for a bean or resource in a Java EE application. When using dependency injection, the `@Named` annotation can be applied to a class, allowing it to be referred to by name in other parts of the application. The `@Named` annotation is primarily used for naming beans or resources in Java EE applications, and making them available for injection using dependency injection frameworks like CDI.

While it is true that the `@Named` annotation is commonly used in conjunction with JavaServer Faces (JSF) to make beans accessible from web pages, this is achieved through the use of EL (Expression Language), rather than by exposing public properties directly.

### <span style='color: grey'>CDI Scopes & Contexts</span>

*Scopes* define the lifecycle of a managed bean or a contextual instance. A scope defines the context in which a bean instance exists, and thus determines how long an instance will be preserved and when it will be destroyed.

There are several built-in scopes in CDI, including:

1. `@ApplicationScoped`: The bean instance is created once for the entire application and lives until the application shuts down.
2. ``@SessionScoped``: The bean instance is created once per user session and lives until the session ends.
3. `@RequestScoped`: The bean instance is created once per HTTP request and lives until the request is completed.
4. `@Dependent`: This is the default scope if no other scope is specified. The bean instance is dependent on the lifecycle of its injection point and is destroyed when its injection point is destroyed.

*Contexts* in CDI refer to the runtime environment that manages the lifecycle of a bean instance. A context is responsible for creating and destroying bean instances, as well as managing their state. Each scope defines a separate context.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>`@Dependent`</span>

`@Dependent` scope is a built-in bean scope that indicates that an instance of a bean has a lifecycle **that is bound** to the lifecycle of **its injection point**.

In other words, when you inject a dependent-scoped bean into another bean, the container will create a new instance of the dependent-scoped bean for each injection point. This means that the dependent-scoped bean instances are not shared between injection points.

<span style='color: brown'>One way to think about the `@Dependent` scope is to compare it to a disposable coffee cup.</span>

<span style='color: brown'>Imagine you're at a café and you order a coffee. The barista hands you a disposable cup with your coffee in it. This cup is dependent on your coffee order - it was created specifically for you, and it will be discarded once you've finished your drink.</span>

<span style='color: brown'>Now imagine that you order another coffee, and the barista hands you another disposable cup. This cup is also dependent on your coffee order - it's a new cup created specifically for this new order. It's not the same cup as before, and it's not shared with anyone else.</span>

<span style='color: brown'>In a similar way, when you inject a bean with a `@Dependent` scope into another bean, the container creates a new instance of that bean specifically for that injection point. That instance is not shared with any other injection points, and it will be discarded once the injection point is destroyed.</span>

The `@Dependent` scope is the default scope for a bean if no other scope is specified. It is also sometimes referred to as the "pseudo-scope" because it has no real scope and is essentially the absence of any explicit scope annotation.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>`@RequestScope`</span>

The `@RequestScope` annotation is used to define a bean's scope to be scoped to an HTTP request.

When you annotate a bean with `@RequestScope`, Spring creates a new instance of that bean for every HTTP request that comes into your application. This means that each user request will get its own unique instance of the bean.

This can be useful when you have objects that store information related to a specific user request, such as data entered on a form or the user's selected language preference. By using request-scoped beans, you ensure that each user request gets its own separate instance of these objects, preventing any interference or confusion between concurrent requests.

> we tell the CDI container, that the contextual instances of bean, to be associated with a `@RequestScope` i.e. an HTTP request.

#### <span style='color: #6B5B95'>`@SessionScoped`</span>

``@SessionScoped`` annotation defines a bean's scope as "session". This means that a single instance of this bean will be created for each user session, and it will be available for the entire duration of that session.

This is useful when you need to maintain stateful information across multiple HTTP requests made by the same user. For example, if you have a shopping cart feature on your website, you could store the contents of the cart in a `@SessionScoped` bean so that the user's cart is persisted between page loads.

It's worth noting that the `@SessionScoped` annotation requires a mechanism for storing session data, such as cookies or URL rewriting. The CDI API doesn't provide this functionality, so you'll need to use a compatible web framework that includes session management to fully leverage the benefits of ``@SessionScoped`` beans.
